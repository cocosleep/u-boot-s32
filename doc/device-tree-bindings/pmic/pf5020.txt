NXP PF5020 pmic

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver:
- drivers/power/pmic/pf5020.c

Required properties:
- compatible: "nxp,pf5020"
- reg:
	* 0x8 - pf5020 unit b
	* 0x9 - pf5020 unit a

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.

Example:

pf5020_a {
	compatible = "nxp,pf5020";
	reg = <0x9>;
	status = "okay";
};

pf5020_b {
	compatible = "nxp,pf5020";
	reg = <0x8>;
	status = "okay";
};
